            make sure you come ready to learn and explore. You can learn about
            Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in
            time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?

            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us
