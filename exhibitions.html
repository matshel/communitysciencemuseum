                        <p>
                            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what
                            we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can
                            be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
                            exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                        <h2>Evolution</h2>
                        <p>
                            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from
                            and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
                            understanding our place in this world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
                            also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos,
                            and a number of dinosaurs too.

                        <p>
                            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the
                            great wonders of the tiny world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
                            growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a
                            look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
                            wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                            The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. From
                            useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and
                            shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
